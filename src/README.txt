Welcome to Number Guesser!

This is a console-based game (for now) where you must guess the number of the evil computer, lest he destroy you (a.k.a.
end the game...). If you get it right, you get to continue in his twisted game... but if you get it wrong, you will face
his wrath!

The game will present you at the end of each round with your guesses, and at the end of its runtime with the stats for
the overall game. Challenge others to see who wins!

See if you can find the strategy that always works, and see if you can use it to beat impossible mode. And have fun!

Any questions/concerns/bug reports can be submitted however Github allows all that to be reported. Alternatively, you
could e-mail the yet-to-be-created grexmakesgames@gmail.com.

Thanks!
